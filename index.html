<h1>Playing for Keeps, 2020</h1>

<p>Well, folks, it’s here. 2020. What a <em>hell</em> of a time to be alive. On the one hand, it’s a marvel. In comparison to the generations that preceded us, we live in rare comfort. I mean, look at us. Radio waves connect our little electronic boxes and transmit the shit we talk to one another in the blink of an eye. We watch baseball wherever and whenever we want. For the most part, we have jobs and healthcare. None of us live out on the street. </p>

<p>Yet, for all the modern world has given us, troubles loom. Global capitals, like ours, will be abandoned or completely transformed to deal with a rapidly changing climate. Animals species across the globe are hurtling towards extinction. Private companies know more about us than our best friends, girlfriends or spouses. Four people own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent of Americans. War rages on. </p>

<p>It’s all too much. Personally, I can’t escape the thought that I’m living through a year that, for better or worse, will be seen as a turning point in human history. This year’s election, in particular, is sure to reverberate through the centuries to come. The heaviness of the moment can be paralyzing, which is part of why I’m so fucking juiced about another year of PFK. </p>

<p>Think about it. We have a full season of baseball, six months of surprise breakouts, long-awaited debuts, Sunday meltdowns, before a vote is cast in the November elections. </p>

<p>If there were ever a year to welcome reliable nonsense and fantasy, it’s this fucking year. I expect much silliness. It’s my only requirement. </p>

<p>Your new commish, </p>
